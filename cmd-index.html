                  A golden fish they say have no hiding place, that was why

                  Staff welfare is a very important factor in enhancing Service
                  delivery in any health oriented Organization, like the UMTH.
                  Prof. Ahmed Ahidjo on assumption of office, took cognisance of
                  the fact that staff welfare is the salt that sweetens whatever
                  achievement he hopes to establish in the hospital, and that
                  staff well taken care of constitutes a formidable force in the
                  life-line of any boisterous institution. Armed with that
                  knowledge, he conducted staff promotions, employments, various
                  training programs, both in the clinical and non-clinical
                  departments, within his one year in office.

                  part of the world, and to overcome this and continue

                  effective service delivery, University of Maiduguri Teaching
