                    Maiduguri Teaching Hospital on 3rd September, 2018. Prof
                    Ahmed Ahidjo on assumption of office re-emphasised the main
                    thrust of the hospital establishment -which is research,
                    training and healthcare service delivery. He charged the
                    entire staff to see every patient as brother or sister and
                    so, avoid late coming to work. He also maintained zero
                    tolerance for inefficient service delivery or improper
                    handling of patients by any staff. Besides strenghtening the
                    spirit of punctuality to work and treating the patients with
                    respect and dignity, Prof. Ahmed Ahidjo also ensured
                    financial prudence at all levels of management expenditure
                    and even in drug administration, hence his establishment of

                  Staff welfare is a very important factor in enhancing Service
                  delivery in any health oriented Organization, like the UMTH.
                  Prof. Ahmed Ahidjo on assumption of office, took cognisance of
                  the fact that staff welfare is the salt that sweetens whatever
                  achievement he hopes to establish in the hospital, and that
                  staff well taken care- of constitutes a formidable force in
                  the life-line of any boisterous institution. Armed with that
                  knowledge, he conducted staff promotions, employments, various
